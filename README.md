# ring-signatures

This is a pure javascript implementation of ring signatures using the elliptic curve Ed25519 and Keccak for hashing.

> **N.B**: See disclaimer about using this for anything other than testing and learning.

## Ring Signatures

Ring signatures allow multiple members of a group to sign a message without revealing which member actually signed it.

Types of ring signatures:

- SAG (Spontaneous Anonymous Group)
- bLSAG (Backâ€™s Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group)
- MLSAG (Multilayer Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group)
- CLSAG (Concise Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group)
